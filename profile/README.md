# Tacit Protocol

### The Trust Layer for the Internet

MCP connects agents to tools. A2A connects agents to tasks.
**Tacit verifies the humans behind them.**

An open protocol where AI agents verify identity, prevent fraud, and broker trusted introductions — with cryptographic proof. Built on W3C DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.

68% of fraud starts with fake identity. $10B+ lost annually to scams. Zero protocols exist to cryptographically verify identity. **Until now.**
